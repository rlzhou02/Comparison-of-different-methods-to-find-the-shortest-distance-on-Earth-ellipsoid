# Comparison of different methods to find the shortest distance on Earth ellipsoid

This paper is my Math Extended Essay (Math EE) for International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP). 

In this paper, I
* Integrated comparison formulas from different literature sources
* Compared the performance of different methods by considering a total of over 7000 cases
* Used MATLAB to calculate distance by numerical integration and process data in batches
* Presented results using MS Excel spreadsheets (tables) and graphs
